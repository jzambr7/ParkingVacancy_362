# ParkingVacancy_362
Final project for CS 362 (UIC), Spring '19. [David Hernandez &amp; Juan Zambrano]

<b>Basic Description:</b>

Using 2 Arduino Uno microcomputers, photoresistors, lasers, and a few Hot Wheels toys, 
our project displays  which position of a "parking space" is taken. If all spaces are 
on the first level taken, then the second level floor display becomes available. 
Each level contains 3 spaces and a total of two levels.
